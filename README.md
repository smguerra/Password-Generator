Password Generator



## Description 


This Password Generator project showcases my skills and talents in the creation of an application that an employee will use to generate a random password and it will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It works by clicking the Generate Password button, then it will present a series of prompts and confirms for password criteria. The first prompt will request the desired number of characters to be contained in the password, then the user will select between a range of character types by clicking the "OK" or "Cancel buttons". Then, the code will validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected by the user; once prompts are answered then the password is generated and written to the page.
